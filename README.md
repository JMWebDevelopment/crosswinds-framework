The Crosswinds Framework gives you a blank canvas that you can create anything from. Whether you are looking to create an online store, a lead generation website or just want a plain blog, whether you want something that looks fancy, formal, casual or anything in between, you’ll be able to create it with The Crosswinds Framework.

If you want to get started with a design created for you, you can check out one of the many Crosswinds Framework child themes (both free and paid). And if you really want to customize your website with the Crosswinds Framework, you can even create your own child theme to create the website of your dreams.

With the Crosswinds Framework, the possibilities are endless with what you can do with your website.

## Blank Canvas
The best part about the Crosswinds Framework is that it truly is a blank canvas for you to create. While there are patterns and some styles set up for you so that you have a starting point, it’s not opinionated, and it’s easy to change those initial designs. Want to use serif fonts? Those are preloaded into the theme. Need to change the colors to match your branding? It’s really easy to make those changes. Want to change the header, footer or any of the templates? No problem.
This is your website, and you get to choose what you do with it.

## Block Patterns
The Crosswinds Framework comes with several different block patterns that allow you to quickly create great pages and posts. From pricing tables to feature blocks to hero sections to headers and footers and more, these patterns can help you craft the perfect page.

## Left/Right/No Sidebar Pages
Want a sidebar on your posts and pages? Don’t want to have any sidebars? Would you prefer you had a sidebar on the left side? No problem! You can choose any style you like for your blog posts, pages and even archive templates to make this website your own.

## Full Page Layouts
Want to create a new homepage or landing page in just one click? The Crosswinds Framework comes with a couple of full page layouts that give you a complete page with a click. All you have to do is fill out the text, images and other content.

## Getting Started
Getting started with the Crosswinds Framework is pretty simple. You’ll be up and running with it on your website in just a few minutes after following these instructions.

- Download the theme ZIP file from the releases page on GitHub.
- Upload the theme to your WordPress website through `Appearance -> Themes -> Add New -> Upload Theme`.
- Activate the Crosswinds Framework theme.

The theme is now active on your website and you can start customizing it to make it your own and fit what you want your website to be.

## Child Themes
- Crosswinds Framework Starter Child Theme (free) - Starter child theme to work with the Crosswinds Framework. Great to use if you want to customize your version of the theme on your website through code.

## Customizing Crosswinds Framework
There are two primary ways that you can customize your version of the Crosswinds Framework: the site editor and a child theme.

### Using the Site Editor
You can use the site editor in the dashboard to customize the theme and the way your website looks. From here you can customize the fonts and colors used on the site as well as set default styling for all of the blocks. And you can change the template parts and templates to really make your website your own.

### Creating a Child Theme
If you really want to customize the Crosswinds Framework on your website (with your own custom block patterns and templates or maybe you’re using the theme to create a website for a client), you can create a child theme. You can use the starter child theme here in GitHub that comes with build tools already set up or create your own child theme. It gives you 100 percent control over how things look on your website.
